**********************
H8/300 EEPROM adapters
**********************

PCBs to adapt H8/300 Hitachi/Renesas MCUs to EEPROM footprints, allowing their
firmware to be read with a standard EEPROM reader.


Available Adapters
==================

- TBD


Assembly Notes
==============

On the EEPROM footprint, headers should be soldered on the back side of the
adapter PCB. Everything else should be assembled as normal.
